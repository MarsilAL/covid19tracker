- What is Observability? What is Monitoring? What is the difference?

Monitoring tells us whether the system works.

Observability lets us ask why itâ€™s not working.

Monitoring an app will get information about the system and let us know in the event of a failure.
Observability is a quality of the app or technology you are using that grants an easy way of seeing what and where it broke.

- answer the questions and try to explain the difference using your own CovidTracker App!

Monitoring will tell me if the tracker is working or not. (Ex: Problem in Trecker setup ).
Observability tell us about the details of the failure, what it is, where it is, and how it happened.(Ex: The registration data is incomplete, an error in getting the geographical location, an error in creating the user, an error in the request).
